* JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides four basic capabilities to developers:
􏰀  * Encapsulation: the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.
􏰀  * Aggregation: the capability to store one object inside another object.
􏰀  * Inheritance: the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or
number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.
􏰀  * Polymorphism: the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.
Objects are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property.
